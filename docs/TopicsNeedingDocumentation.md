# Topics Needing Documentation

Our documentation is not perfect--this file consists of a list of topics that currently aren't or are not well documented.

## Usage/Configuration

### Plugin System

Currently not really documented outside of code in the SARIF SDK.

### Rule Configuration

Although a user can generate valid configuration via the `ExportConfig` command, this system is not well documented outside of code in the SARIF SDK--both from a "modifying config for usage" and "developing new rules" perspective.

## Developer Documentation

### Coding Style

We should document the coding style expectations for BinSkim, including naming conventions for projects/namespaces/classes/methods/etc., spacing conventions, etc.

### Rule Writing

A document on how to write a new rule would be valuable for new contributors.  Also, the philosophy on errors versus warnings, importance of good results, etc. should be documented.
